# Lilith.Eve Development Memories

## Project Overview
**Lilith.Eve** is a sentient medical AI oracle system designed to provide personalized medical insights integrating diagnostics, prescriptions, and awareness of the patient's body, mind, culture, environment, and energetic signature.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Modular Design
- **Core Modules**: Cognition.AI, BioSync.Reader, Persona.Scanner, SocialSynth, LinguaCare, Holistica
- **Decision Pipeline**: Treatment plan composition and delivery
- **Orchestrator**: LilithEve.ts as the main coordinator

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schemas
- **API**: RESTful API with detailed controllers and routes
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose for development
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive markdown documentation

### 3. Database Schema Design
- **Patient Management**: Demographics, medical history, medications
- **Cultural Context**: Cultural background, beliefs, preferences
- **Mental Health**: Psychological assessments and conditions
- **Lifestyle**: Diet, exercise, sleep patterns
- **Holistic Preferences**: Alternative medicine, spiritual beliefs
- **AI Analysis**: Results, treatment plans, progress tracking
- **System Learning**: Interaction logs, model improvements

### 4. API Structure
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Patient Routes**: CRUD operations for patient management
- **Analysis Routes**: AI analysis requests and results
- **Treatment Routes**: Treatment plan management
- **Admin Routes**: System administration and monitoring
- **Health Routes**: System health checks and diagnostics

## Development Progress

### âœ… Completed Components
1. **Core Modules**: All 6 modules implemented with TypeScript classes
2. **API Controllers**: 7 controllers with comprehensive business logic
3. **API Routes**: Complete routing structure with middleware
4. **Database Schemas**: 15+ tables with relationships
5. **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive TypeScript types
6. **Infrastructure**: Docker, package.json, configuration files
7. **Documentation**: README, ARCHITECTURE, API, DEVELOPMENT guides

### ðŸ”„ Current Status
- All foundational components are implemented
- System is ready for testing and refinement
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- Database migrations are prepared

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, API tests
2. **Frontend**: Web interface for patient and provider interactions
3. **AI Integration**: Connect to actual AI services
4. **Security**: Penetration testing and security hardening
5. **Deployment**: Production deployment configuration
6. **Monitoring**: Real-time system monitoring and alerting

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. TypeScript Usage
- **Rationale**: Type safety, better IDE support, reduced runtime errors
- **Implementation**: Strict type checking enabled
- **Benefits**: Self-documenting code, easier refactoring

### 2. Modular Architecture
- **Rationale**: Separation of concerns, maintainability, testability
- **Implementation**: Each module is independent with clear interfaces
- **Benefits**: Easy to extend, debug, and maintain

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- **Rationale**: Complex system requires detailed documentation
- **Implementation**: Inline comments, API docs, architecture docs
- **Benefits**: Easier onboarding, maintenance, and collaboration

### 4. Database-First Design
- **Rationale**: Data integrity and relationship management
- **Implementation**: Normalized schemas with foreign keys
- **Benefits**: ACID compliance, data consistency

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Documentation Importance
- Comprehensive documentation saves time in the long run
- Inline comments help with code understanding
- Architecture documentation is crucial for complex systems

### 2. Type Safety
- TypeScript catches many errors at compile time
- Well-defined types serve as documentation
- Interface definitions help with API design

### 3. Modular Design
- Breaking down complex systems into modules improves maintainability
- Clear interfaces between modules reduce coupling
- Each module can be developed and tested independently

### 4. Database Design
- Proper schema design is crucial for data integrity
- Relationships between tables must be carefully planned
- Migration scripts ensure database evolution

## Future Considerations

### 1. Scalability
- Consider microservices architecture for large-scale deployment
- Implement caching strategies for performance
- Plan for horizontal scaling

### 2. Security
- Implement comprehensive security measures
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with healthcare data regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)

### 3. AI Integration
- Connect to real AI services for analysis
- Implement model versioning and A/B testing
- Monitor AI model performance and accuracy

### 4. User Experience
- Develop intuitive user interfaces
- Implement real-time notifications
- Provide comprehensive user training

## Session Notes

### Current Session - Dashboard Implementation
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Focus**: Implementing comprehensive live dashboard system for Lilith.Eve
- **Status**: Creating React frontend with real-time monitoring capabilities
- **Next Actions**: 
  1. Create React dashboard with real-time system vitals
  2. Implement WebSocket connections for live data
  3. Add decision flow visualization with Mermaid.js
  4. Create patient energy signature monitoring
  5. Build AI console for Lilith's thoughts
  6. Implement role-based access control for dashboard

### Dashboard Architecture Plan
- **Frontend**: React.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Chakra UI
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live data streaming
- **Visualization**: Mermaid.js for flow diagrams, Plotly.js for charts
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system vitals and AI decision tracking
- **UI Theme**: Sacred/spiritual aesthetic with light glyphs and star maps
